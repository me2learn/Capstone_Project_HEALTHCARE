## PROBLEM STATEMENT:

NIDDK(National Institute of Diabetes and Kidney Diseases) research creates knowledge about and treatments for the most chronic, costly and consequential diseases.
The dataset used in this project is originally from NIDDK. The objective is to predict whether or not a patient has Diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

Build a model to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not. 

## RESULTS ACHIEVED:

Basic Logistic Regression algorithm is predicting 6 / 10 inputs correctly,

whereas the best performing SVC algorithm is predicting 9 / 10 inputs correctly.
